Project: Adjustable Backpack for Package 
by Tyler Edwards 
FUTURE PROJECT

Description: Make 3D models of molds that will allow me to create climbing holds. 

Software: Autodesk Fusion, PrusaSlicer
Material: PLA Filament

Reason: I was thinking of practical applications of 3D printing when I found a video of a backpack that adjusted to the size of a package, so the user coukd carry it easier. It seemed like something I could 3D print and use so I decided to start brainstorming designs. Plus, the freedom to design its functionality and aesthetics sounds like a fun challenge.

Plan: 
        1. Create a basic sketch of the backpack design along with the adjustment mechanism.
        2. Make a more detailed sketch, with measurements and any other parts that will not be printed (straps).
        3. Model the different parts individually in Fusion360, according to the sketches.
        4. Slice and print the parts one at a time.
        5. Piece together the backpack.
        6. Test the prototype.
        7. Make any necessary adjustmenets to the design. 
        8. Repeat this process until the backpak will adjust to hold different sized boxes.
